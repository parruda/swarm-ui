7. âœ… Added seed data for initial testing
8. âœ… Created comprehensive test suite
9. âœ… Fixed all test failures
10. âœ… Created missing views (directories, instance templates)

### Next Steps
1. Create and merge PR

## Testing Progress
- [x] Model tests (77 tests passing)
- [x] Service tests (34 tests passing)
- [x] Controller tests (74 tests passing)
- [x] System/integration tests (created and passing)
- [x] Terminal functionality tests (created and passing)

## Total Test Coverage
- 185 tests passing
- 0 failures
- 0 errors

## Issues & Resolutions

### Initial Implementation
- âœ… Fixed migration order (swarm_configurations needed before sessions)
- âœ… Created cable databases for ActionCable
- âœ… Fixed Pathname handling in service tests
- âœ… Added missing columns to sessions table (working_directory, worktree_path, launched_at)
- âœ… Fixed factory configurations for all models
- âœ… Resolved pg gem segmentation fault by disabling parallel tests

### Additional Testing Phase
- âœ… Fixed SimpleForm Tailwind configuration (removed undefined custom inputs namespace)
- âœ… Fixed test environment to raise exceptions instead of rendering error pages
- âœ… Fixed instance template tools format (arrays vs comma-separated strings)
- âœ… Created missing views (directories: index, show, new, edit, _form)
- âœ… Created missing views (instance_templates: show)
- âœ… Fixed directory params to prevent path updates after creation
- âœ… Fixed configuration form to use correct model name (swarm_configuration)
- âœ… Fixed encoding issue in directory show view (replaced invalid character)
- âœ… Fixed terminal controller test mocking (use controller instance mocking)
- âœ… Fixed session restoration (handle NOT NULL session_path constraint)
- âœ… Added route helpers to test_helper for URL generation

## Notes
- Using tmux for all interactive sessions as per plan
- No modifications needed to claude-swarm gem
- Prioritizing core functionality over UI polish initially
