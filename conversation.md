# SwarmUI Terminal Connection Debugging Session

## Date: 2025-07-04

## Initial Problem Report
The user reported that the main "Launch Swarm" feature wasn't working, with the following issues:
1. Configuration file select box showed no options
2. Form submission wasn't creating sessions properly
3. Terminal page showed "Connecting to terminal..." indefinitely
4. "View Logs" link caused "Couldn't find Session" error
5. Service-worker.js causing 404 errors

## Problems Attempted to Solve

### 1. Configuration File Discovery (‚úÖ SOLVED)
**Problem**: The configuration file dropdown was empty and only looked for `claude-swarm.yml`
**Solution**: 
- Created dynamic configuration loader that discovers all YAML files when directory changes
- Added validation to check if YAML files are valid swarm configurations
- Updated to show all valid swarm config files, not just `claude-swarm.yml`

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb` - Added `find_config_files` and `valid_swarm_config?` methods
- `/app/controllers/api/sessions_controller.rb` - Added config discovery API endpoint
- `/app/javascript/controllers/configuration_loader_controller.js` - Created new Stimulus controller
- `/app/views/sessions/new.html.erb` - Updated form to use configuration_loader controller

### 2. Form Submission Issues (‚úÖ SOLVED)
**Problem**: SessionsController#create was passing wrong parameters to SwarmLauncher
**Solution**: Updated controller to create Session object before passing to SwarmLauncher

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb` - Rewrote create action to properly instantiate Session
- `/app/services/swarm_launcher.rb` - Now receives Session object instead of params hash

### 3. Session View Links (‚úÖ SOLVED)
**Problem**: Links were passing session object instead of session_id string
**Solution**: Updated all link helpers to use session.session_id

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/app/views/sessions/show.html.erb` - Fixed logs and stop links
- `/app/views/sessions/index.html.erb` - Fixed terminal links

### 4. Service Worker 404 Errors (‚úÖ SOLVED)
**Problem**: Missing route for service-worker.js
**Solution**: Added empty service worker route

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/config/routes.rb` - Added `get "service-worker.js" => proc { [200, { "Content-Type" => "text/javascript" }, [""]] }`

### 5. Terminal WebSocket Connection (‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY SOLVED)
**Problem**: Terminal page loads but WebSocket doesn't connect
**Discoveries**:
- ActionCable wasn't mounted in routes (fixed)
- Import paths for consumer were incorrect (fixed)
- ActionCable configuration needed updating (fixed)
- WebSocket infrastructure now works with test channels

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/config/routes.rb` - Added `mount ActionCable.server => '/cable'`
- `/config/environments/development.rb` - Added ActionCable configuration
- `/app/javascript/channels/consumer.js` - Added debug logging
- `/app/javascript/controllers/terminal_controller.js` - Fixed import path and added debugging
- `/app/javascript/application.js` - Removed incorrect channels import
- `/config/cable.yml` - Changed to async adapter for development

### 6. JavaScript Module Loading (‚úÖ SOLVED)
**Problem**: Stimulus controllers couldn't import ActionCable consumer
**Solution**: Fixed import paths and ensured importmap was configured correctly

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/app/javascript/controllers/terminal_controller.js` - Changed import from "../channels/consumer" to "channels/consumer"
- `/app/javascript/controllers/output_viewer_controller.js` - Same import fix

## Test Files Created
- `/test_terminal_with_selenium.rb` - Selenium test for form submission
- `/test_websocket_connection.rb` - WebSocket connection test
- `/test_terminal_simple.rb` - Simplified terminal test
- `/test_terminal_visible.rb` - Visible browser test
- `/test_terminal_direct.rb` - Direct API test
- `/test_create_and_check.rb` - Session creation and monitoring
- `/test_terminal_final.rb` - Comprehensive test script
- `/test-swarm.yml` - Test swarm configuration
- `/example-configs/dev-swarm.yaml` - Example swarm configuration

## API Endpoints Created
- `GET /api/sessions/discover` - Discovers configuration files in a directory

## Channels Created
- `/app/channels/test_channel.rb` - Test channel to verify WebSocket functionality

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
1. Configuration file discovery - dynamically loads all valid swarm YAML files
2. Session creation - forms submit and create database records properly
3. Tmux sessions - are created successfully when launching
4. WebSocket infrastructure - ActionCable connects and test channels work
5. API endpoints - return proper JSON responses

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Fully Verified:
1. TerminalChannel - Haven't seen actual terminal output/input working
2. ClaudeTerminalProxy - PTY connection to tmux not tested end-to-end
3. Real-time terminal display - xterm.js integration not confirmed

### üöß Known Limitations:
1. SwarmLauncher uses placeholder `bash` command instead of actual `claude-swarm` binary (line 41 in `/app/services/swarm_launcher.rb`)
2. Terminal connection not fully tested due to server startup issues at end of session

## Important Configuration Requirements
For ActionCable/WebSockets to work:
1. Rails server must be running (`bin/rails server`)
2. ActionCable must be mounted in routes
3. Cable adapter should be configured (async for development)
4. Request forgery protection should be disabled for ActionCable in development

## Next Steps
1. Replace placeholder command in SwarmLauncher with actual claude-swarm command
2. Test TerminalChannel connection with a running server
3. Verify terminal input/output works properly
4. Test non-interactive mode
5. Test worktree functionality

## Key Insights
- ActionCable runs as part of the Rails server - no separate WebSocket server needed
- The async adapter is perfect for development as it runs in-process
- Import paths in JavaScript modules must match the importmap configuration
- Stimulus controllers need proper data attributes (underscores, not dashes)
- Configuration discovery should be dynamic based on directory selection
